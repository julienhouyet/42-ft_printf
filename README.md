# 42-ft_printf

By now, you must be fed up alternating the ft_putstr and ft_putnbr functions when doing your printing. Are you not allowed to use printf? You can recode yours! It will be a chance for you to discover a feature of the C language – variadic functions – and to practice detailed management of the printing options. You will then be allowed to use your ft_printf in all your future projects.
