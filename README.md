# Introduction

ft_printf was one of the first projects to be carried out at 42. The aim is to re-code the printf function in order to understand how it works. In future projects, the use of printf is forbidden, but we can use our own ft_printf function.

At [42 School](https://github.com/42School), almost every project must be written in accordance to the [Norm](https://github.com/42School/norminette/blob/master/pdf/en.norm.pdf), the school's coding standard. As a result, the implementation of certain parts may appear strange and for sure had room for improvement.
